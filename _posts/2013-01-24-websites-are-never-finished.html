<p>When you start designing or developing a website, it's like painting a picture: it's never finished. A website, whether it's a personal blog or a full-fledged application, will always have improvements that can be made.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Art is never finished, only abandoned.&rdquo; - Leonardo da Vinci</p></blockquote>

<p>The <em>real </em>art is knowing when you can stop. At a certain point, the benefits to each brush and key stroke start to taper off. The question becomes, "When is it good enough?"</p>

<p>I think that's why "lean startup" and "minimum viable product" are such popular terms in the tech space now. They are the acceptance that you'll never truly finish. When you think of all the things that <em>could </em>go into the website, it's easy to get overwhelmed. But when you keep things simple and instead focus on just a few of the main features, things become much more manageable.</p>

<p>Unlike a painting that gets hung on the wall, a website doesn't have to be left alone once it's out there for everyone to see. So don't abandon it, either. It's allowed to adapt and change over time.</p>

<p>Once I realized that I might never truly finish a website or be totally satisfied with its current state, I started to enjoy the process again. Just don't give up along the way.</p>
